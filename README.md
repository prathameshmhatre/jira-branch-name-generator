# Jira Branch Name Generator

    Sometimes we do not have our Jira board linked with version control like gitlab.
    We manually create the branch name by the copying the ticket number from the jira page and text
    to create the ticket.
    In order to reduce some time for this manual work we will be creating this chrome extension.
    Based on the type of ticket we will generate for starting feature/<ticket-number>-<title-of-ticket> or
    bug/<ticket-number>-<title-of-ticket>
